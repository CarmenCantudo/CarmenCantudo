### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**CarmenCantudo/CarmenCantudo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Portfolio Project 1: HTML/CSS Essentials
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Networking and Systems Security from CCT College Dublin & Software Development (E-commerce Applications) from Code Institute
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Web Development
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CarmenCantudo) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ccarmenccm/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter

#### Want to Build Your Own?
Do you like my profile and want to build your own? It's very simple. GitHub recently added a new feature called <b>Profile Readmes</b>. For it to work, do the following:

<ol>
  <li>Create a special GitHub repository with your username as repository name. My username is <code>CarmenCantudo</code> so my profile readme repository has the name <code>CarmenCantudo</code>.</li>
  <li>Add a <code>README.md</code> to this repository.</li>
  <li>Put some cool content about yourself (or anything you want) into <code>README.md</code>.</li>
</ol>
And that's about it. The <code>README.md</code> of your profile readme repository will be displayed on your profile page.
